    "### 240 Food Chain\n",
    "#### Problem Description\n",
    "In the animal kingdom, there are three types of animals: A, B, and C. These animals form an interesting circular food chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A eats B,\n",
    "- B eats C,\n",
    "- C eats A.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are \\( N \\) animals, numbered from 1 to \\( N \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each animal is one of A, B, or C, but we do not know which type each one is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements about the food chain relationships among these \\( N \\) animals are made in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first type of statement is `1 X Y`, indicating that X and Y are the same type.\n",
    "- The second type of statement is `2 X Y`, indicating that X eats Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone describes the food chain relationships among these \\( N \\) animals with \\( K \\) such statements, which are a mix of true and false statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement is considered false under any of the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The statement conflicts with some previous true statements.\n",
    "- In the statement, either X or Y is greater than \\( N \\).\n",
    "- The statement claims that X eats X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine the total number of false statements based on the given \\( N \\) and \\( K \\) statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains two integers \\( N \\) and \\( K \\), separated by a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following \\( K \\) lines each contain three positive integers \\( D \\), \\( X \\), and \\( Y \\), separated by a space, where \\( D \\) indicates the type of statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\( D = 1 \\), it indicates that \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "If \\( D = 2 \\), it indicates that \\( X \\) eats \\( Y \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Output a single integer representing the number of false statements.\n",
