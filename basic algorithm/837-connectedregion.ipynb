    "#### Problem Description\n",
    "Given an undirected graph with \\( n \\) vertices (numbered from 1 to \\( n \\)), initially, there are no edges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you need to perform \\( m \\) operations, and there are three types of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `C a b`, add an edge between vertex \\( a \\) and vertex \\( b \\). \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) may be the same;\n",
    "- `Q1 a b`, query whether vertex \\( a \\) and vertex \\( b \\) are in the same connected component. \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) may be the same;\n",
    "- `Q2 a`, query the number of vertices in the connected component containing vertex \\( a \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line inputs two integers \\( n \\) and \\( m \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following \\( m \\) lines each contain an operation instruction, which is either `C a b`, `Q1 a b`, or `Q2 a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "For each query command `Q1 a b`, output a result. If \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are in the same connected component, output `Yes`; otherwise, output `No`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each query command `Q2 a`, output an integer representing the number of vertices in the connected component containing vertex \\( a \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each result should be on a new line.\n",
