    "#### Problem Description\n",
    "Suppose there are \\( N \\) piles of stones arranged in a row, numbered 1, 2, 3, …, \\( N \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pile of stones has a certain mass, which can be described with an integer. Now, these \\( N \\) piles of stones need to be merged into one single pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time, only two adjacent piles can be merged, and the cost of merging is the sum of the masses of these two piles. After merging, the stones adjacent to these two piles will become adjacent to the new pile. The total cost of merging can vary depending on the order of merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider 4 piles of stones with masses 1, 3, 5, and 2. One might first merge the 1st and 2nd piles at a cost of 4, resulting in 4, 5, 2. Then, merge the 1st and 2nd piles again at a cost of 9, resulting in 9, 2. The final merge would then cost 11, for a total cost of 4 + 9 + 11 = 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the second step were to first merge the 2nd and 3rd piles, the cost would be 7, resulting in 4, 7. The final merge would cost 11, for a total cost of 4 + 7 + 11 = 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to find a method of merging that results in the minimum total cost and output this minimum cost.\n",
